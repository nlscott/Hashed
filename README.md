## Generate or Compare Files Hashes

#### Usage:
Use Hashed.app to generate a file hash for MD5, SHA1, SHA256, or SHA512.

You can also use Hashed.app to verify the hash of a file you have downloaded. Type or paste the hash into the "Compare hashes" field, then use the "File to compare" field to select the file that was downloaded.

Hashed.app does not hash folders or directories, only individual files. If you want to hash a directory, zip the entire directory and hash the zip file.
